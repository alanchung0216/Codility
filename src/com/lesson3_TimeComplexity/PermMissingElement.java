 	Lesson 3 - 3 PermMissingElem

	Find the missing element in a given permutation.
	https://codility.com/programmers/task/perm_missing_elem/

	the key for this is to know what permutation is.
	it â€™s consecutive integer.
	the array hold N integers from  1 to N+1 but the array
	size is N so one number is missing. 
	if we know the total of 1 to N+1 then we simple subtract  total
	of array from total of 1 to N+1 and we will find the answer.

	Note we could also solve this problem using Count Array (see 4-1)
